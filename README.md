# P2Photo
P2Photo is a mobile application that allows users to store photos on mobile devices without using centralized storage. Users can store photos, create albums, share albums with other users, provide photo storage for other users and use other usersâ€™ devices for photo storage. The basic architecture of P2Photo relies on a central server and a client mobile application.
